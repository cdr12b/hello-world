Learning GitHb

Hello I am new to github but do have programming experience in c++ and python. I am a physics student
who also works in unix. I would like to contribute to projects and gain experience in order to 
obtain a programming job. I also have a lot of interest in learning machine learning and ai and would
like to learn as much as I can on these subjects.
